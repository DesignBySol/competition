• White, Diplodia. This is the most harmless of them all! It’s safe to eat with the mould, but just put it off if you’d prefer.

• Turquoise, Penicillium. The blue and white mold that makes blue cheese and penicillin, and make lemons and bread moldy. In ancient times, soldiers took this moldy bread with them on campaigns to use to prevent infection from war wounds. It’s harmless but cut it off before enjoying your cheese if your prefer.
• Gray-brown and fuzzy, Botrytis – 
Apart from being a bit icky, this will do you no harm. It is the bacteria that makes sweet dessert wine after all! Just chop off and enjoy your cheese.

• Black, Aspergillius niger – This can cause illness so throw it away just to be sure.

• Pink, Red Purple Fusarium and Gibberella
Eek, not good! Especially if this is slimy don’t breathe this in and get rid of the cheese ASAP.
