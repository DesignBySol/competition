    			<h2>Everything you thought about food expiry dates is wrong</h2>
    			<p>Use By and Best Before dates on food are often mistaken for markers of safety.</p>
                <p>"If I eat this after the day, horrible things will start happening to me, right?"</p>
                <p>Wrong.</p>
                <p>These dates were first introduced as a guidance and as a marker of quality and not safety but all this confusion makes it unsurprising that 60% of the food thrown away in the UK is still perfectly safe to eat. If food waste were a country, it would be the third largest producer of greenhouse gasses in the world, after China and the USA. Yep, it's a big problem.</p>
                <p>This is why we made this handy little tool, so you can learn how to tell if your food is off or not yourself and save yourself up to &pound;700 a year (the average amount of good food a family wastes) and be kinder to the awesome place that we call home.</p>

                    <li>Buy the amount you need and not the biggest pack. You're not saving any money if you end up throwing it away!</li>

    			<h2>Recipes</h2>
    			<p>Here are some ideas for using up food that has passed its best:</p>
                <p><b>Stale bread:</b> Make breadcrumbs, french toast, bread &amp; butter pudding, croutons, garlic bread.</p>
                <p><b>Milk/yogurt:</b> Stick whiffy dairy into a pancake mix as the heat will sterilise everything and you won't taste the difference!</p>
                <p><b>Fruit:</b> Chuck it all into a blender and make a delicious smoothie. Yum.</p>
                <p><b>Vegetables:</b> Ditto to the above but this time boil it with some water to make a soup.</p>
